      <p>
        Call me Ishmael. Some years ago&mdash;never mind how long precisely&mdash;having
        little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
        shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
        the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
        circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever
        it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
        involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear
        of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an
        upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
        from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
        people&rsquo;s hats off&mdash;then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.
